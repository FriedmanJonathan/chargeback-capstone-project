    "This notebook details the design of a ML classification model which helped Credorax, a smart payments provider, tackle one of the biggest nuisances to the business: chargeback. After exploring and cleaning the data provided, our team (shoutout to Amy, Adi, and Vladi!) managed to design a model which, if implemented, would **increase profits by an average of 2%.**\n",

    "My personal contributions to the projects centered on feature engineering, translating the business problem into appropriate evaluation metrics, and optimizing some of the classification models. With my peers' permission, I've taken the liberty of organizing the entire project in a single notebook (as opposed to the multiple Google Colab files we worked with) in order to help aspiring data scientist understand good practices and techniques when analyzing real-world data for real-world business problems.\n",

    "**Chargeback** is the payment amount that is returned to a debit or credit card, after a customer disputes the transaction or simply returns the purchased item. The chargeback process can be initiated by either the merchant or the cardholder’s issuing bank. Merchants typically incur a significant fee from the card issuer when a chargeback occurs. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since part of Credorax's business is enabling transactions for merchants (and taking a percentage of the transaction), they are negatively affected when they fail to preemptively block a sale in which the chargeback ultimately occurs: this false negative (type II) error results in loss of business due to an unsatisfied merchant using Credorax's services. However, Credorax naturally can't afford to label valid transactions as chargebacks (a false positive, type I error) - aside from the loss of business from the sale, Credorax's reputation is tarnished and the customer's lifetime value will decrease. Let's summarize these scenarios in a table, along with the company's estimates of profits or losses for each case:"

    "So - what must a prudent data scientist do before modeling? Here's a simple checklist to get us started:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Loading the data.** This may be trivial if we're given a single CSV or JSON file, but in many cases we'll be given our data in parts (and therefore will need to use **joins** and **concatenations**) or in more advanced formats (e.g. zipped or pickled files).\n",
    " \n",
    "2. **Examining the data.** What is the **size** of our dataset? How many **features** do we have to work with, and are they all relevant? Are there many **missing values** for some of the features? Are the features **correlated**?   In the vast majority of cases, the answers to these questions will involve:\n",
    " \n",
    "3. **Visualizing the data**, by using Python's major packages, such as **pandas** for data structure and **matplotlib** or **seaborn** for basic and advanced charts and plots (but there are many options, choose what suits you best!). Common visualizations include bar charts for examining the distribution of categorical data, scatter plots and heat-maps to examine correlation, or perhaps even a violin plot (good for comparing two groups side by side) if you're feeling fancy. \n",
    " \n",
    "4. **Transforming the data**. In some cases, we'll need to make some changes before we're ready to unleash some models: we might need to **impute** missing data (perhaps by using the mean) or **drop** the problematic features or samples entirely; we may choose to **disregard features due to irrelevancy or high correlation** to other features "

Further reading about both topics is encouraged!\n",
